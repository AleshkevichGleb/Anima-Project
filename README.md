## Structure of the project

In the src folder you will find the entire structure of the project, then the paths will be indicated relative to this folder. 
* The "assets" folder contains fonts and pictures.
* The "common" folder contains small components that are reused inside other components (for example, a button or a title).
* The "components" folder contains all the components of the project.
* The "data" folder contains all the data that is used in the project (some imitation of the back)
* The "hooks" folder contains custom hooks.
* The "pages" folder contains project pages, inside which components from the "components" and "common" folders are already called
* The "reducers" folder contains the store.js, which combines slices (reduxjs/toolkit) for working with data and queries

### Outside the folders are "index.js" (input point to the project) and App.js, which is called inside index.js and calls some code(components) inside itself

## About code

The statemanager is Redux(npm -i redux), data is entered into slices - createSlice (npm -i @reduxjs/toolkit), redux-saga (npm -i redux-saga) is used to work with queries.
